In this project, I am assuming myself as the Data Analyst for Coffe House, I performed Data Analysis in Python by using some libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Performed Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis, Plot Charts or Visualized Data.

Lastly at the end of project, I prepared Analysis Report or Dashboard of my Data Analysis with an executive summary for the various stakeholders or create a functional Dashboard using Power BI to assist owner in making data-driven decisions.
